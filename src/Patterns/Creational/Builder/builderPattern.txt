Builder is a creational design pattern that allows to create complex objects on a step-by-step basis.

Problem: Sometimes, we may not require all the fields to create the object.
In that case, we should either pass null values to the constructor or create lots of constructors.

Solution: Builder pattern extracts the object creation into a separate class called builders.
Builder classes have the same fields as of the actual class and each field have a reserve setter method (without set prefix)
And it additionally has a build() method that creates and returns the object that builder is supposed to create.
The build() method uses the constructor created in the actual class

Director:
In case of repeated use of code while constructing object, Director class is used to define the order in which we should call
the construction steps so that we can reuse specific configurations of products we are building.
Director classes are optional while using builder pattern.
