Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern which creates new objects by cloning existing instances. it is ideal
when object creation is expensive and many similar objects are needed.

Design:
1. Create an interface for prototype that has clone method.
2. Implement the interface for the classes that requires cloning.
3. In case of reference variables, ensure to follow deep copy instead of shallow copy.
(With shallow copy, the reference of the reference variables is pointed to the original reference variable.
With deep copy, a new reference variable is created while cloning the original object)

Prototype Registry class is used to centralize commonly used prototypes. The prototype objects are maintained in a Map to clone
them when requested.
